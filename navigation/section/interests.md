### My Interests - Predicting the Future in Video Games: Metal Gear Solid 2

(The story for these games is quite complex, so here is an [article](https://www.svg.com/147452/the-entire-metal-gear-timeline-explained/) that sums up things pretty well.)

Released in 2001, Metal Gear Solid 2, created by legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima, was the sequel to the massively succesful and wildly influential Metal Gear Solid, widely considered to be one of the pioneers of the modern stealth game. Metal Gear Solid 2 followed up with the story outlined in the first game, but instead of following the exploits of legendary protagonist Solid Snake, the series went in a different direction and instead focused on the story of Raiden (a change that was not recieved warmly) and his journey through a web of lies, conspiracy, and mind-bending revelations that could change the course of history forever .

Although I wish I could go into depth about every detail of this masterpiece of a game, that is not what this page is about, instead I wish to talk about how this game released near the turn of the century managed to predict the rise of social media and its dramatic consequences on humanity as a whole, as well as the terrifying effects of A.I. and the ease of the spread of misinformation in the modern digital age.
