Especially the one that essentially does what Synergy does (but tbh wayy better) by allowing you to enter grades, give feedback, and basically everything you can think of for entering and computing grades. Overall, i really enjoyed it! I hope that PUSD reaches out to these guys to make a new Synergy! \n",
