### My Interests - Predicting the Future in Video Games: Metal Gear Solid 2

(The story for these games is quite complex, so here is an [article](https://www.svg.com/147452/the-entire-metal-gear-timeline-explained/) that sums up things pretty well.)

Released in 2001, Metal Gear Solid 2, created by legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima, was the sequel to the massively succesful and wildly influential Metal Gear Solid, widely considered to be one of the pioneers of the modern stealth game. Metal Gear Solid 2 followed up with the story outlined in the first game, but instead of following the exploits of legendary protagonist Solid Snake, the series went in a different direction and instead focused on the story of Raiden (a change that was not recieved warmly) and his journey through a web of lies, conspiracy, and mind-bending revelations that could change the course of history forever.

Although I wish I could go into depth about every detail of this masterpiece of a game, that is not what this page is about, instead I wish to talk about how this game released near the turn of the century managed to predict the rise of social media and its dramatic consequences on humanity as a whole, as well as the terrifying effects of A.I. and the ease of the spread of misinformation in the modern digital age. 

## The Malleability of Public Opinion

Probably the most accurate and relevant prediction made by Metal Gear Solid 2 was just how easy it is for public opinion to be warped and influenced by social media in the current digital age. The way that Metal Gear Solid 2 (or MGS2 for short) explored this topic was in two distinct ways: Echo Chambers and Fake News.

### Echo Chambers
"Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid of a larger forum.
They stay inside their little ponds leaking whatever "truth" suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large. The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is invalidated, but nobody is right" 

This quote, coming from the end of the game in one of the most famous speeches in gaming, predicted a pretty recent concept in social media known as echo chambers. Echo chambers are defined as, "an environment or ecosystem in which participants encounter beliefs that amplify or reinforce their preexisting beliefs by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal." Echo chambers do nothing but surround social media users with things that will please and agree with them, detaching them from the world as a whole, and as a result a new wave of ignorance and intolerance has overtaken all manners of discourse online and even in the real world.

### Fake News 
"But in the current, digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness. Never fading, always accessible. Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander...All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate."

Continuing on with how easily public opinion can be manipulated, MGS2 also managed to predict that in the modern era of digital information, the line between truth and lies has been blurred to a point where there is no distinction, and people are all too willing to eat it up regardless.
