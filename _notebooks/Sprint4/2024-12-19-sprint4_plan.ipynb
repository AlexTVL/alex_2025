    "## Overview of contributions\n",
    "My contributions to the level were that I changed the background for our level and adjusted the snow, so that it was bees now, and I made them come horizontally across the screen, going from right to left.\n",

    "## How I survived \n",
    "\n",
    "Man, this is a crazy question but its pretty much a mystery to me as well! In all seriousness, I learned quite a bit in this Sprint, mostly more about the interconnectedness of everything and just how finicky the code can be.Another big thing I learned was how to manage multiple different branches and how to make pull requests more efficient (thanks lucas!) I made a total of 10 commits throughout the time we worked on the game, which I wish was higher, but was still quite a lot compared to everyone else (no shade).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Commits \n",
    "![Screenshot 2024-12-18 141057](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3abaaaeb-7f1d-4487-be5b-6c542b1f057c)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What I wish I could have done better\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I personally think I dedicated quite some time into this project overall, there are definitely some mistakes I made and things I wish I could have done better. One big mistake I feel I made was that I wasn't the best at coordinating with my teammates so some changes like the sprites didn't come to fruition as on my part, I failed to properly communicate with my fellow team-members.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not only that, but I also feel as a whole, we got too ambitious with the ending, and as a result we weren't able to have a concrete idea of exactly how we were going to accomplish this other than some pretty strong ideas. Hopefully when we get back from break we can fully narrow-down exactly how we are going to rectify these mistakes and make our game for the better!\n",
