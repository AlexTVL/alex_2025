    "Testing is the process of evaluating a system or its components to determine whether it meets the specified requirements. It involves executing the software to identify any defects or issues and ensure that it behaves as expected.\n",

    "Verification is the process of ensuring that the software meets the specified requirements and is free of defects. It involves reviewing and inspecting the software to ensure it is built correctly.\n"

    "Pull Requests are a feature in source control systems that allow developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository. A pull request is a request to merge changes from one repository to another  repository, especially with forking involved. GitHub has a built in pull request feature for repositories, making life a whole lot easier for us when we are moving changes around."
