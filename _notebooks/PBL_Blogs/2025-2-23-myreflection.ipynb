    "My strengths in the class I feel cosnsisted of how dedicated I could be to this class. I spent so many hours and a lot of commits just grinding through and getting things done. My ability to create plans I believe was probably the best application of my dedication, though my actual work could be better\n",

    "Honestly, I don't think CompSci is the best for me to be honest. I find it intriguing and it can certainly be fun a good amount of the time. Not only that, but I have made some great memories in this class as well. Despiet this though, I am terribly impatient at times, and the fickleness of code can be very frustating at times (another weakness of mine). \n",

    "Who knows though? Maybe I will learn to love it later on, I certainly had a rocky relationship with it at times throughout the year, but there were times I really found a lot of enjoyment in it. Even then, the stuff I have learned is important regardless if I want to specifically focus on CompSci as a career, as just having the know-how, is bound to be a critical component later along down the line when I am trying to get a job.\n",

    "In short, even if I don't necessarily want to fully pursue CompSci in my academics or my career, I still think the things I learned here were very important and I am glad I took this class, no matter what direction I take in life."
