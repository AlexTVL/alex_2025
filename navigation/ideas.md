# Ideas Revamped:

<br>

## First Level

    - Basic intro/tutorial, several NPC's (will get to later) and some questions to be answered
    - Takes place in a medieval setting, all sprites themed accordingly 
    - Two characters, both skeletons with one being smaller for the sake of being able to distinguish who is who
    - NPC's will be interactable, with the third and final npc being the one that you answer questions with, allowing you to move on to the next level

## NPC Details 

I have a sprite sheet with numerous different characters on it already, so I won't have to go exploring the internet to find one.

    - Knight NPC - First guy you are supposed to talk to, tells you to go to the next NPC as he is the guy who knows the guy who will get you out of here 
    - Villager NPC - Second guy you are supposed to talk to, tells you to go to the guy who will get you out of here (These NPC's are here for the sake of you getting used to the controls and how the game will be played) 
    - Soldier NPC - Third guy you are supposed to talk to, this NPC will give you a series of questions that you have to answer correctly to be able to move on to the second level 

(All of their names correspond to their sprites when they will be implemented into the game)
