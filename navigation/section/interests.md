### My Interests - Predicting the Future in Video Games: Metal Gear Solid 2

(The story for these games is quite complex, so here is an [article](https://www.svg.com/147452/the-entire-metal-gear-timeline-explained/) that sums up things pretty well.)

Released in 2001, Metal Gear Solid 2, created by legendary video game developer Hideo Kojima, was the sequel to the massively succesful and wildly influential Metal Gear Solid, widely considered to be one of the pioneers of the modern stealth game. Metal Gear Solid 2 followed up with the story outlined in the first game, but instead of following the exploits of legendary protagonist Solid Snake, the series went in a different direction and instead focused on the story of Raiden (a change that was not recieved warmly) and his journey through a web of lies, conspiracy, and mind-bending revelations that could change the course of history forever.

Although I wish I could go into depth about every detail of this masterpiece of a game, that is not what this page is about, instead I wish to talk about how this game released near the turn of the century managed to predict the rise of social media and its dramatic consequences on humanity as a whole, as well as the terrifying effects of A.I. and the ease of the spread of misinformation in the modern digital age. 

## The Malleability of Public Opinion

Probably the most accurate and relevant prediction made by Metal Gear Solid 2 was just how easy it is for public opinion to be warped and influenced by social media in the current digital age. The way that Metal Gear Solid 2 (or MGS2 for short) explored this topic was in two distinct ways: Echo Chambers and Fake News.

### Echo Chambers
"Everyone withdraws into their own small gated community, afraid of a larger forum.
They stay inside their little ponds leaking whatever "truth" suits them into the growing cesspool of society at large. The different cardinal truths neither clash nor mesh. No one is invalidated, but nobody is right" 

This quote, coming from the end of the game in one of the most famous speeches in gaming, predicted a pretty recent concept in social media known as echo chambers. Echo chambers are defined as, "an environment or ecosystem in which participants encounter beliefs that amplify or reinforce their preexisting beliefs by communication and repetition inside a closed system and insulated from rebuttal." Echo chambers do nothing but surround social media users with things that will please and agree with them, detaching them from the world as a whole, and as a result a new wave of ignorance and intolerance has overtaken all manners of discourse online and even in the real world.

### Fake News 
"But in the current, digitized world, trivial information is accumulating every second, preserved in all its triteness. Never fading, always accessible. Rumors about petty issues, misinterpretations, slander...All this junk data preserved in an unfiltered state, growing at an alarming rate."

Continuing on with how easily public opinion can be manipulated, MGS2 also managed to predict that in the modern era of digital information, the line between truth and lies has been blurred to a point where there is no distinction, and people are all too willing to eat it up regardless. Fake news has become an everyday thing for most people in the country, and this quote perfectly encapsulates the impact social media has had on humanity as a whole.

## Ever Present, Ever Watching

Metal Gear Solid 2 didn't just predict what would happen a decade in the future, it also predicted stuff that would happen in mere months. In the aftermath of 9/11, President George W. Bush signed off on the Patriot Act, which allowed the government to be able to expand their authority to monitor phone and email conversations and essentially be able to spy on almost every piece of digital information that is connected to you. Of course, the Patriot Act is one of the most controversial acts passed in the 21st century as despite being made with the intention of combating terrorism, it can just as easily be used for far more nefarious purposes. Surpirsingly, the concept of an enigmatic and ever illusive government spying on its people is a major part of both the story and themes of this game, and is another shinning example of the level of prescience that this game was made with.

## The Rise of A.I.

(Context: This picture is of the believed heads of the Patriots, the organization that secretly controls America. It is revealed at the end of the game that they have all been dead for over a century, and that the Patriots are actually a network of A.I, with their creation and creators being explored in later games.)

Ok I lied, social media wasn't the most important prediction made by MGS2, it was A.I. A.I has in the past few years experienced a renaissance like no other, and while this unprecedented wave of technological advancement is indeed impressive, the danger of A.I and the damage that it could cause is one thing that has been concerning experts, and MGS2 showed these consequences in superbly well-written form.

One of the most iconic parts of Metal Gear Solid are the Codec calls, which is a feature that allows you to call several of your allies for help, additional story details, etc. During important parts of the game, your allies usually call you and this usually advances the plot forward. In MGS1, your commanding officer is Colonel Roy Campbell and in MGS2 he returns, but he is not what he seems. During the last part of the game it is revealed that everything you have gone through has been orchestrated by the Patriots, and the "Colonel" is actually nothing more than an A.I in one of the finest twists in gaming.

The concept of A.I impersonating people hasn't been more well executed in gaming than MGS2, and the level of detail and foreshadowing that precedes the twist is mind-boggling. A.I impersonating people is a terrifying subject that has become a deeply pressing issue that needs to be dealt with, but that wasn't the only A.I prediction that MGS2 made. It also predicted the greater integration of A.I. and robots in the military and the effects of wars no longer being fought with flesh and blood but steel and wire.

## Conclusion

I hope that reading this gave you a little bit of insight into one of my favorite games of all time and why I think it is so brilliant and timeless, and that I didn't bore you too much with my ramblings. 

And remember: "Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of life we can. Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing." - Solid Snake 

Thanks for reading!
