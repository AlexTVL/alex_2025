# My Ideas

Here are some of my ideas for my RPG game!

    - Add collectibles, like coins 
    - With collectibles, there could be an actual end to the game
    - Possibly create enemies that chase the player
    - Add sound effects to the game
    - Add multiple areas for the player to explore
    - Allow for a customizable player (be able to find armor, weapons, etc)
    - Enhance the visual aspects of the game
    - Maybe add NPCs that could potentially give quests


## Here is an image gallery that corresponds to my ideas!
